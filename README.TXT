Description:

	This is a basic logistics manager for tracking inventory from a company's main stock hold to a warehouse.
It allows the creation of Inventory Items that can me moved from the Inventory tab, loaded onto a truck, and
finally sent to the Warehouse tab. The Warehouse tab is meant only for informational purposes in terms of the
delivery. In the future it could be expanded by using a database as to give it persistant data from run to run.
Also, many optimal restraint would be added to make the program more user friendly. The Customer.cs class is
only added as an example of a future update that could expand upon deliveries from this company's warehouse
to their various customers. My main goal with this program was to show a very simple and usable system written
in C# that included a basic but user-friendly environment, and well-written code adhering to proper coding
standards. Thank you for your time.
